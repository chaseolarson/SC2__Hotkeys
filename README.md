# SC2__Hotkeys

This is a conversion of [TheCore Hotkey Setup for SC2](https://goo.gl/wQwQp7) to a Redox Keyboard.


## Hotkeys

## Mapping
This image shows the keys on my Redox in black text and the keys from the US QWERTY Right version of TheCore v6.
This is the original mapping. A few hotkeys may have been swapped for personal preference after the original remapping.
